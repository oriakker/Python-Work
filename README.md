# Python-Work

Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 are self-contained assignments set by my lecturers during my deep learning course. The rest of the files are for my end-of-module group project.

The data document holds a link to the dataset used and the GLoVe file contains the word embeddings used in the models.


Then there are the two code files (and I also included the pdf writeup that we submitted).
